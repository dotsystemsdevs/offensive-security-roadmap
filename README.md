## Phase 2: Web Application Analysis
Goal: Identify and exploit web-based vulnerabilities.
Purpose: Web interfaces are primary entry points for initial access.

- Step 2.1: OWASP Top 10

## Phase 3: Exploitation and Post-Exploitation
Goal: System compromise and lateral movement.
Purpose: Executing full attack chains.

- Step 3.1: Host Exploitation
